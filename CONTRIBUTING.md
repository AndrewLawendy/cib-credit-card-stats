# Contributing in CIB Expenses Stats

First of all thank you for taking the time to contribute :heart_eyes:<br />
You can pick a task from the todo list in the `README.md` or you can make your own within the aim of adding a new functionality, fix a bug or improving performance.

# Branch Naming

All fixes and performance improving are bound the last default branch, only in case of adding a major functionality then we can add a new default branch `VER.{n}`. <br />
**Examples**:
The difference between the `VER.01` and `VER.02` that the latter has the option to upload an `.xlsx` file which wasn't supported in `VER.01`.

# Pull Requests

- Update the `README.md` with a change log explaining the differences you added and their impact if possible.
- Pull requests shall be reviewed by code owners and can only be merged by the code owners.
- Upon pushing a new major change, the pull request will simply be closed and the branch will be renamed as per our convention and set as the new default branch in GitHub and Netlify.

# Submit bug or feature request

Please refer yourself to the to the right template whether it's a [bug report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) or a [feature request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and submit your issue upon it.

# Git commit messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji as a convention to categorize the purpose of the commits.<br />
  You can use [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vtrois.gitmoji-vscode) as a convenient way to prefix your commit messages.

# Contributing from Windows

It's preferable that you install `EditorConfig` and apply it to your code editor to avoid any unnecessary commits due to the difference between the end of line on different os.<br />
If you're a VS Code user you can download the extension through this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).
